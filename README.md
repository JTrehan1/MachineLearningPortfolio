Hi, I’m Jai — a Mathematics & Statistics graduate and software engineer with a growing focus on data and machine learning. I’ve worked on cloud-native applications, built data pipelines, and delivered technical solutions directly to clients — but I’m now keen to shift towards a more analytics-driven role where I can better apply my mathematical background to solving real-world problems.

This portfolio is part of that journey — a place to share what I’m learning and building as I develop my skills in machine learning, data engineering, and applied analytics. I’m especially interested in exploring how data and tech can intersect with the things I love, like sport, music, and DJing.

Thanks for stopping by — feel free to check out the projects!
